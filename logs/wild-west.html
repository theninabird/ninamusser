<body class="">
    <div class="entry-content" style="max-width: 650px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p>A tumbleweed rolls by.</p>
        <p>Music from ‘The Good, the Bad and the Ugly’ starts to play, and Cole steps out, dressed like a cowboy.</p>
        <p>The music continues and Christian steps out, dressed in a lovely bonnet and dress, looking disgruntled, waving a handkerchief half-heartedly.</p>
        <p>Zillah Warrior Princess leans back on her bar stool to get a better look at the newcomers. “I don’t think that uns from ’round ‘ere.”</p>
        <p>Cole glances at Christian and frowns. “Sweet mother of the source, you look ridiculous. Did /Will/ put you up to that?” He pauses. “Where /is/ he, anyway?”</p>
        <p>Will appears behind Christian, in a white hat and cow-spotted chaps.  “Step aside, lady,” he drawls in an accent that is very much not Cockney, but low, slow Western.  “I’ve gotta scooore to settle.”  He narrows his eyes at Cole.</p>
        <p>Christian siiiiighs and tries to undo the ribbon on the bonnet. “I lost in rock, paper, scissors on who had to be the girl.”</p>
        <p>Cole gasps and spins around, eyeing Will fiercely. “So, you curr, you’ve decided to show your mangy face around here again, have you, Baron de Bubblesworth?” A glance is shot towards the lovely lady at the bar. “You might want to watch yourself, ma’am. This one’s a fiend and no doubt about it.”</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha chews on a piece of straw and lifts her cowboy hat to Zillah. “Them look like strangers in theeese parts, ya heeear?”</p>
        <p>Angrily Christian still fights to remove the bonnet, looking like he might stab the next person who calls him a lady, with his fan.</p>
        <p>Baron de Bubblesworth nearly sputters at Cole’s vocabulary, his sweaty palms loosening his grip on his gun.  “Uh .. yuh-yes,” he stammers, fidgeting with his pistol.  “.. Yeah, I AM a–” POP goes his gun, a cork on a string flying out of it and hitting him in the side of the head.  “OY!”</p>
        <p>Damsel Christian fans himself moodily, staring at the wall.</p>
        <p>Zillah Warrior Princess eyes them. “Oh, I hear ya. Don’t knows what they’d be wantin’ in a place like this. Oh, there ya go. They be selling those cork guns.”</p>
        <p>“GET DOWN!” Sheriff Cole yelps as the gun goes off, steeling himself against the bang- er. Pop. Pop?! Eyeing the Baron once again, this time with much suspicion. “Just what game are you playin’ at, scum?”</p>
        <p>The Baron knows his answer to this question.  Recovered from his accident–which didn’t even leave a red mark–he stares Cole down.  “Monop’ly, Sheruff.  I’m the racecar, an’ you jus’ landed on my Boardwalk.”  What!?  He raises and aims his gun, before hastily jamming the cork back into it.  Then he aims it again.</p>
        <p>“Oh my.” mumbles Christian with little conviction, batting his long lashes from behind his flowery fan and crossing his legs.</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha nods and flicks the brim of her hat. “They be trouble makers, darnit! We don’t like folks who be playing Monop’ly in our humble town!”</p>
        <p>“WHAT!?” What!? indeed. Sheriff Cole takes a wary step backwards, one hand hovering over the pistol at his side, the other flung up to point at the Baron de Bubblesworth… pointedly. “You… y-you’re the racecar?” His features twist to a snarl as he brings up his own gun and aims. “You’re the one that SANK MY BATTLESHIP!”</p>
        <p>Missy Paiden McQuesty orbs in beside Pipsha, wearing neon green leggings and a giant pink-spotted top, her hair in a ponytail on top of her head.  “So, are we going to watch Saved by the–”  But no one else is dressed in 80’s clothes!  ….</p>
        <p>Zillah Warrior Princess downs the rest of her drink. “It’s those silly street names that get me. That, and that the money ain’t real. What’s the point in playin’ if it ain’t fo’ nothin? I ask you. Trouble makers, indeed.”</p>
        <p>THAWP. Christian’s trying to squash flies with his fan until he’s jabbed in the ribs and remembers to give a girlish gasp. “Oh no. Cole loved tha’ battleship, t’was like his noble steed.” He drawls, eyeing the whisky.</p>
        <p>From somewhere in the Hakkuwakk Makok, Christian can probably her Phoeras yelling “CHRISTIAN! CHRIIISTIAN! Paiden /LEFT ME BEHIND/ again!”</p>
        <p>“IT WAS, it WAS!” roars the Baron, both hands on his gun as he drops to his knees and throws back his head, pulling the trigger with another hollow ‘pop!’.  “AND I’D DO IT AGAIN!” he hollers, recocking his pistol quickly–which does nothing, because the cork’s still hanging out–and firing again.</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha rolls her eyes and hisses to her little sister. “80’s day was LAST WEEK, remember? That’s all over now.” Turning back to Zillah she leans on the bar, and stares in deep thought. “If only monop’ly money was real, theys all be sayin’ but it never will be, s’like tryin’ t’glue feathers t’a darn polecat an’ call it a chicken!”</p>
        <p>Reaching for the whiskey, Christian sighs as he hears the call and orbs out to collect the last sister. As long as his child doesn’t see him dressed like this. …………o.o;</p>
        <p>Missy Paiden McQuesty stares at her sister for a second or two, jaw clenched a little, before giving in and throwing herself into a chair.  “Yars, yarss ..” she mutters in a very dull attempt to join their conversation.  “… Hey.  What’s Will doing?  Is Cole SHOOTING WILL?  COLE!”  Even though it’s very obvious that it’s the other way around, Paiden is on her feet as quickly as she was off of them.</p>
        <p>Zillah Warrior Princess nods. “But t’will never be a chicken. Oh no. Why couldn’t they be sellin’ chickins now? At least they be worth somethin’ ’round ‘ere.”</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha leaps up to grab Paiden by the back of the collar “SHHHHHHH. I want to see this! DON’T SPOIL IT.”</p>
        <p>Sheriff Cole, somehow, recoils from the mighty blow of the cork-gun and lets out a roar, firing back at Will twice, thrice… five times! “WHY’D YOU DO IT!?” he screams dramatically, one hand clutching his, uh, cork-wound. “YOU KNEW YOU COULD NEVER GET AWAY WITH IT…” Problem is, -his- pistol was actually loaded with bullets.</p>
        <p>Christian returns with Phoeras in a blue swirly orby glow. The zebra is ranting. “She told me it was 80’s! Now I just look /stupid/!” She’s covered in slap-bands, has a ponytail on one side of her head, and even managed to dig up a skinny neck-tie.</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha says, “HEY! SLAP-BANDS. Let’s have a slap-band race! WHO’S IN?”</p>
        <p>“BECAUSE YOU DID IT WITH THE ROPE IN THE–” Will chokes as he’s hit by an onslaught of bullets.  “.. Lii-iBERRY,” he strangles out.  His body gives a weird lurch, and his pistol drops from his hands.  “Uh-hrr.. C-.. Chr-Christian?”  With a lick of his lips, the Infamous Baron–hey, now he’s the Bloody Baron!–topples over.</p>
        <p>Storming back to his chair Christian flops into it dramaticly and flops down into it, crossing his legs and fanning himself furiously. “WYATT CALLED ME MOMMY, I HOPE YOU’RE HAPPY.” He’s jabbed in the ribs again. “I mean. Oh dearie me, whatever shall we do, who is going to win this fearsome fray?”</p>
        <p>Growling until he’s forced from his chair, Christian leaps up and kneels beside Will. “OH NO. What’ve you done.” He doesn’t sound like he really cares. “Oh my brave Will, you have to survive.” Christian, then performs his Whitelightery magic and heals Will.</p>
        <p>Cole’s knees buckle and he slumps to the ground also, his pistol slipping from his fingertips. “I DID!” he wails, grief-stricken. “I ADMIT IT, IT WAS ME. I never thought I’d be found out!”</p>
        <p>Phoeras finally seems to clue into the situation as well, and simply… stares. And blinks, every now and again, but mostly stares, with her jaw hanging open and her eyes wide, her expression quite clearly stating; ‘omgwtf’.</p>
        <p>Will’s eyelids stop doing that creepy jittery thing, and he peers up at Christian with a look of wholesome appreciation.  “Why, Ma’am ..” he says in a raspy voice, “.. I do believe thurr’s only one way I c’n repay you.”  Grabbing Christian roughly around the neck, Will lets on a smooch there ain’t been the likes of around these parts in years.</p>
        <p>Paiden, her topsy ponytail sagging, stares alongside Phoeras.  “Will.. kissing boys ..”  Her left eye twitches.</p>
        <p>A small bird, distracted by gaping at the unholy smooching, smashes into a wall and falls down.</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha slurs angrily whilst hugging the burben bottle, peering over at Will smooching. “Thoseer-muh lips varmit! Gerroff.”</p>
        <p>(bourbon?. OMG)</p>
        <p>Cole, beginning to realise that nobody’s paying any attention to /his/ trauma, pulls himself up to look at whatever everyone else is staring at- and gags. “Wha-!?” His nose crinkles. “Hooo, lordy.”</p>
        <p>Missy Paiden McQuesty falls back into her seat and yanks Pipsha’s whiskey away from her before taking a melancholy swig.  “He never kisses ME like that,” she whimpers.</p>
        <p>Looking disinterested in everything, Christian heals. Then he’s smooched, with a muffled scream of horror he fights like he’s being tackled by a giant octopus. The bonnet is still not dislodged.</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha snort giggles and slumps onto the bar. “Heza gudsmooch.”</p>
        <p>And Will has plenty of spit to go around, even after chewing on Paiden’s tail all night.  With a gracious ‘smack’, he pulls his lips off of Christian and stares at him.  “.. Y’should wear those clothes more offen.  They bring out yore eyes!” he chirps, and then stands up.  “SHERUFF,” he barks, peering at Cole again.  “.. I ‘ope you’ve learned yore lesson.”</p>
        <p>Sheriff Cole slowly shakes his head from where he is on his knees on the ground. Clearing his throat, he can’t -quite- meet the Baron’s eyes. “Ohhh, don’t you worry, I’ve /learnt/. Sweet moses on a pumpernickel, have I learnt.”</p>
        <p>Duchess Ras slowly, stiff-legged, walks out to Cole and tries to help him up. “Uh. Come on, dear. Let’s see if we can’t find something to erase some of -both- our memories.”</p>
        <p>Horrified for eternity, Christian, stares blankly, face contorted in a sort of silent scream of absolute terror, head turned to Pipsha in hopes of some consoling words or something.</p>
        <p>Peasant Pipsha wrinks at Christian, lifting a glass in a wobbly fashion before wolf-whistling.</p>
        <p>Baron Gudsmooch brushes his hands together in a sort of ‘that’s done’ manner.  “Well, good,” he replies, nodding his head.  “‘Cos I’ve got to go write in my diar– journal.  About somethin’.”  Turning around, he makes to walk off ‘stage’, but pauses long enough to click his teeth at Christian on his way out, which only makes Paiden howl more loudly.</p>
        <p><strike>Paiden pounds her fists on the bar and throws her head back, tears streaming down her face.  “ALONE FOREVER!” she screeches, among other bits of, “PANSY!” and “MAN-TOUCHER!”</strike> <em>(This line ages very poorly.)</em></p>
        <p>Duchess Ras and the Sheriff both fold back their ears, trying to block out the sounds of screaming and muffled-screaming… eventually they both just give up, and, in a dreadful 80’s-cowboy-hybrid embrace, shimmer out.</p>
